# Tsuro Card Counter

This little script count the possible number of cards in the game of Tsuro.
It consider rotational invariance.

 I number the cards like so:

<pre>
|-- 0 - 1 --|
7           2
|           |
6           3
|-- 5 - 4 --|
</pre>


### Error
There is still an error in this script! Whoops
